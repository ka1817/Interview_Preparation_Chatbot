Project Overview
This project contains a series of practice interview questions in the AI and ML domains, alongside their sample answers and explanations. It also provides a feedback mechanism for refining your responses. The goal is to cover a broad range of topics, from foundational machine learning concepts to advanced deep learning and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By engaging with the content, you can gain a deeper understanding and be ready for real-world interview challenges.

Key Areas Covered:
Machine Learning Concepts (Supervised vs Unsupervised, Overfitting, Bias-Variance Tradeoff)
Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)
Model Evaluation (Loss Functions, Performance Metrics)
Algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs, K-means, etc.)
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Practical Coding Challenges (in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
